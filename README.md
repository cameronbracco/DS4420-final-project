# DS4420-final-project
Final Project for DS4420 - Machine Learning and Data Mining 2


## Data Loading

Upon cloning, run `python3 mnist.py` to download and save a local version of the dataset. 

## Running Stuff

NOTE: Before you run the first time, make sure you have run `pip install wandb` and logged in
using `wandb login` 

Once logged in with `wandb` running should be as simple as `python3 main.py`

If you do not want to sync data to the cloud, run `wandb offline`. This can then be toggled again
using `wandb online`.
